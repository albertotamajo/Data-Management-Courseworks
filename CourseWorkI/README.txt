##Description##

This project aims to analayse some files containing reviews of some TripAdvisor
Hotels by using bash commands.Specifically, the final aim of this project is to
create a bash script capable of counting the reviews of each TripAdvisor hotel
contained in the following archive: https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp1204/coursework/dataset/reviews_dataset.tar.gz
and rank  the hotels according to the review count so that the hotel with the most
reviews is at the top of the list.
This project also contains a report written in LaTex which explains what the bash script does.
